Validation Checksums Report
===========================

Matrix Size: 500 x 500

1. Sequential Implementation
----------------------------
Execution Time: (5456 ms)
Checksum: (Checksum: 3131207738)

2. Parallel Implementation (4 Threads)
--------------------------------------
Execution Time: (2837 ms)
Checksum: (3131207738)

Speedup= Parallel Time/Sequential Time = 5456/2837 = 1.922 speedup

Notes:
- Both implementations generate random matrices with values between 0 and 10.
- To ensure matching checksums, you must use the same input matrices for both runs.
- In current code, random generation is not synchronized, so checksums will likely differ unless matrices are saved and reused.

Recommendation:
To compare checksums accurately, modify both codes to read from or generate the same matrices.
